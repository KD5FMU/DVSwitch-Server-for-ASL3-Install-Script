# DVSwitch-Install

In the name of making things a little simpler, I thought I would put together a bash script to help streamline the installation process of DVSwitch server for AllStarLink version 3. 

Before downloading we recommend switching to the /tmp folder to download this script file into.

```
cd /tmp
```
Then download the script file
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KD5FMU/DVSwitch-Server-for-ASL3-Install-Script/refs/heads/main/dvswitch_asl3
```

Once downloaded you will need to make the file executable.

```
sudo chmod +x dvswitch_asl.sh
```

Then you can lauch the script file.
```
sudo ./dvswitch.sh
```

Once the file launches you will be prompted to answer yes 'Y' of No 'N' just answer the way you see fit and let the script run it's course.

After the install is finished you will still need to switch to the /usr/local/dvs folder and configure DVSswich Server for ASL 3

```
cd /usr/local/dvs
```

Then lauch the setup by executing the following command
```
sudo ./dvs
```

Configure and Enjoy DVSwitch server for ASL 3

You may reference these two videos I released on YouTube to assist with the setup of DVSwitch.
